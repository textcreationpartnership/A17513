         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For I beare them record (the greateſt number of them) that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb facs="tcp:7779:7"/> And it may bee, many of their ſeducers are themſelues firſt ſeduced by the cunning of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Rabbines,</hi> who yet (the moſt of them) know full well, (and very often confeſſe in their writings, as I ſhall manifeſtly ſhew in handling the chiefe points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted betwixt vs) that Proteſtants hold the truth, and themſelues haue ſwarned from pure Antiquity.</p>
            <p>In tender commiſeration therefore, and yerning bowels of compaſsion vnto the ſeduced, I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this great labour, with neglect of my ſelfe, my health, and ſtate, to doe good to their ſoules, and good to my Country, by vniting them (ſo far as in me lyeth) firmely to be the true Church of Chriſt, and the body of this State. And I haue caried my ſelfe with that ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart, that I may ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againe with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> I ſpeake the truth in Chriſt, I lie not,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.1. &amp;c.</note> my conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt I renounce the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking (nor writing) in craftineſſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.2. &amp;. 2.17. &amp; 1.12.</note> nor handling the word of God (or diuine things) decitfully: but by manifeſtation of the truth, commending my ſelfe to euery mans conſcience in the ſight (and feare) of God.</p>
            <p>I am no Innouator, inventer, or fauourer of new things in Religion. I ſearch for the old, and out of all kinde of Authors deduct allegations, authorities, conſequences and reaſons againſt the new. I cut off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant, needleſſe, and endleſſe queſtions, priuate opinions both of theſe and former ages: and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the neceſſary points of Religion agreed vpon by the Scriptures, Fathers, and moderne diuines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their owne true limits: I ſet downe the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall points agreed vpon betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and vs: and ſhew withall their vnneceſſary additions and corruptions. I ſearch how corruptions came into the
<pb facs="tcp:7779:7"/> Church (as they will doe into all ſocieties of Men in continuance of time) I ſhew how they were diſcouered, oppoſed, and reformation wiſhed and ſought for in all former ages: and by what power, policies, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they preuailed after Sathan was looſed. I finde and ſhew the out-cries of hiſtorians, and other learned men, Emperours, Princes, Clergy, and people, yea of their owne writers againſt them, all before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. And all this while, I ſhew the continuance of all neceſſary ſauing doctrine in many other famous Churches beſide the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea and within that Church alſo a ſufficient viſible number of many hundred thouſands farre and wide ſpread in Countries and Nations, and continewing till <hi>Luthers</hi> time, which refuſed the gouernment, errors, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Papacy, and taught the ſame ſubſtance of doctrine which Proteſtants now teach. Yea, the better part of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely the Papacy, and the faction that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it) held with great liberty the ſame moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary points of Faith which we doe, vntill by the Councell of Trent (which was not a free end generall Councell, but guided wholly by the Papall faction) that liberty was taken away, and the errors of the Papacy were impoſed generally vpon all, vnder paine of <hi>Anathema,</hi> or depriuation of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Vpon due ſearch of theſe and many other things (which heere I deliuer vnto thee) in the Scriptures, Fathers, Hiſtories, and all kinde of Authors of either Religion, I haue by the grace of God attained to that perfect knowledge and aſsurance of the <hi>Verity Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the Proteſtants doctrine to <hi>good life</hi> in this world, and <hi>eternall ſaluation</hi> in the world to come, that any mortall man can deſire to

               </gap> expedient, and the times deſire it) to ſuffer for it, as the holy Martyrs were for this ſame Religion in the Primitiue Church; not writing any thing in ſubſtance which I will not willingly ſeale with my blood. This is it (deare Chriſtian Reader) which I preſent vnto thy view in this worke, being a Summe or Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many great volumnes written on both ſides, vpon theſe points, and thus briefly deliuered for thy greater caſe in reading and perfecter iudging of Truth and Errour, Sincerity and Corruption, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Nouelty.</p>
            <p>To anſwer all the <hi>Romiſh</hi> bookes (lately come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in great numbers) punctually following their owne method, had beene an endleſſe labour both to Writers and Readers: and therefore (for my part) I thought better to gather their principall motiues and reaſons out of the chiefeſt of their bookes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating them into ſeuerall Chapters, to giue them their full anſwer in their proper places; ſo anſwering many bookes in one. Among the ſtore of all other Allegations, I haue moſt willingly and commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Reader to the late Writers of our owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that eſpecially for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the excellency of our Authors, ſurpaſsing others, both in multiplicity of reading, profundity of Iudgement, and ſincerity of affection, in deliuering the truth. As we finde in our learned Biſhops, <hi>Iewel, Abbots, Bilſon, Morton, Vſher, Downham, Hall, White, Andrew, &amp;c.</hi> And our Doctors, <hi>Fulke, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, Whitakers, Field, Favour, White, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, &amp;c.</hi> And other Diuines, Maſter <hi>Foxe, Perkins, Hooker,</hi> and many other: whoſe worthy labours, I doe heartily commend to the diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:7779:8"/> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> men. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> affected, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know, that thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> which haue fled from vs, and written on their ſide, haue in ſhew of wit and learning gone beyond, not onely all former, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Age: So that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes moſt out of them in the points whereof they haue written: as <hi>Sanders, Allen, Stapleton, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore let no man contemne their owne Countreymens wits and learning: but acknowledge their worth, and make high account of their learned labours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to ſhew that I bring no new thing of my ſelfe, but what is fully confirmed by our moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued writers: and that I alſo thankfully remember and honour them, <hi>Per quos profecerim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to ſhew the vnity of the Writers of our Church from the beginning of the Reformation to this time, contrary to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſlanders, which charge vs with continuall varying from our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to ſhew to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> men eſpecially, where they may read in our learned <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers more fully, of the points which I deliuer briefly; for their better inſtruction and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, becauſe my ſelfe am aged, and not fit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the encreaſing weakeneſſe of my body and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, hereafter (if any flouriſhing buſie wits liſt to oppoſe) to manage this cauſe, without much diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, and to my ſelfe: I thought good to alleadge many worthy Diuines now liuing, that they might take vpon them the defence of their owne writings by me alleadged, or impoſe it vpon others more able in body then my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Further, I confeſſe, that it much troubled me, that I could not make my booke ſhorter, without either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it too obſcure, and vn-intelligible: or elſe cutting
<pb facs="tcp:7779:9"/> off much matter fit to giue the fuller ſatisfaction. For by this length of it, (I doubt) it will become tedious to many, to reade it thorow, and cary away the matter in their memory. But I haue helped this Inconuenience as much as I could, <hi>(1)</hi> by diſtinguiſhing the whole matter into Chapters, euery Chapter being (as it were) a ſeuerall Treatiſe by it ſelfe, which may be read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; without reference to the rest, And <hi>(2)</hi> by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Chapters (if they be long) into Sections, (and ſometimes alſo the Sections into Subſections) and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphes (marked thus §) ſetting downe the ſummes of the Chapters and Sect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons, in the beginning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: for the quicker finding or refinding of the matters therein contained; and the eaſier view and carrying away of the whole forme of the diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Stile in Treatiſes of this nature is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Rhetoricall to pleaſe the eare, or as Sweet-meates to delight the Taſte; but Scholaſticall, Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Theological, that is, intelligible and ſignificant to informe the vnderſtanding, and conuict the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Which if it performe, It is all that I affect, or thou maieſt in reaſon expect in ſuch a worke. And now I leaue it to thy diligent reading and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, wiſhing thee often to commend both the Writer and Readers to God in thy prayers;</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rom.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I would haue you to thinke, that I haue a great care of my ſaluation, and in ſimplicity of my heart, and tenderneſſe of conſcience, and not for any other by reſpect, I haue ſought the true way to ſaluation, and doubt not but I haue found it. And therein I am ſo well ſettled, that you may ſpare your labour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt not, but in the ſimplicity of your heart, and deſire of the truth, you haue laboured in this
<pb facs="tcp:7779:22"/> waighty matter. For I haue obſerued you alwayes to be of an honeſt diſpoſition, ſober, temperate, aduiſed &amp; of diſcreet conuerſation: for which faire carriage of life you haue gained the ſurname of <hi>Candidus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Good natures mis-led are much to bee pittied.</note> And I haue alſo found you zealous of Gods honour. So farre as your knowledge did lead you. The more it grieueth me, that ſo honeſt a nature ſhould be abuſed &amp; mis-led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by bad Teachers. But I pray you conſider that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was blameleſſe in life, deuout and zealous in his Religion, when it was erronious (as you are now) and thought his courſes maruellous godly, and much tending to Gods glory. He was inſtructed by <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2.3. Phil. 3.6.</note> a learned Doctor, according to the perfect manner of the Law of the Fathers (as was then thought) &amp; was zealous towards God, and touching the righteouſneſſe of the Law, blameleſſe: and of very zeale perſecuted the true Church of God: and thought he was bound in conſcience to doe many things contrary to the name of Ieſus.<note place="margin">A &amp; s 26.9.</note> So that men may thinke, they are in the holy way of truth, and may be deuout and zealous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and yet be farre wrong. As we hold thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion to be at this day, who perſecute the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of Chriſt which profeſſe to hold the doctrine of the holy Scripture entire, without admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any other grounds of Religion. Remember what our bleſſed Sauiour foretold,<note place="margin">Iohn 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enit hora, vt omnis qui interficit vos, arbitretur obſequium ſe praeſtare Deo.</hi> The time commeth that whoſoeuer killeth you, will thinke he doth God ſeruice.

So that people that are deuout and zealous in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet may be in the wrong: and had need well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their groundes.</p>

               <p>Theſe examples may as well be applied to the Proteſtants, as to the Catholiks.</p>

               <p>You apply them to the Proteſtants: wee to your new Catholiks. Let the vnpartiall world Iudge, who are the perſecutors, and who are the perſecuted. But hereby you may ſee, mortall men muſt not be too haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolued, but firſt thorowly examine the truth of their groundes, wherevpon they build their Faith. Leſt they run amiſſe, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, though taught by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel;</hi> and as the deuout honorable-women, and chiefe men of the City did, being ſtirred vp by the <hi>Iewes.</hi>

               <p>But when a man is well reſolued vpon good grounds: why ſhould hee diſquiet himſelfe, and call his Faith into queſtion againe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>The queſtion is whether his grounds be good or no. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his conuerſion, and theſe honourable-women thought as well of their grounds, as you doe of yours: and yet were deceiued in them. But beſide this, there is another reaſon, why you ſhould thorowly know the ſtrength of your grounds, to wit for the winning, ſatisfying, &amp; confirming of others. To which end S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.) Be alwayes ready to giue ſatisfaction to euery one that asketh you a rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of the hope that is in you with meeknes and feare.

                  <p>I may compare the whole Church of CHRIST in all her ages to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 5.</note> who was honourable for bringing ſafety to his Nation. He was firſt pure and ſound, and did many honourable acts, and thereby repreſented the Primitiue Church, pure and cleane, without ſpot or diſeaſe appearing: howbeit there might be ſome ſecret ſeedes of diſeaſes vnpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which in continuance of time grew into a viſible leproſie. In his middle time he became leprous, diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deformed, fowly infected in himſelfe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting others, and thereby repreſented the later Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Afterwards by the Prophets directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was waſhed and cleanſed from his leproſie, and his fleſh reſtored to become pure and perfect, like the fleſh of a yong childe, and thereby repreſented our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches.

                  <p>Thirdly, obſerue (as a conſequent of the former) that our Church is ſo farre from being new, that it is moſt ancient: the very ſame Church that our Sauiour Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles firſt founded. We ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them both in ſucceſsion of perſons, as well as the Church men of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ſucceſsion of doctrine much better: So that we iuſtly challenge our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be ours: all the learned holy Fathers to be ours: the ancient Councels, the bleſſed Saints, Martyrs and Confeſſors to bee ours. For they taught, profeſſed, liued and dyed in, and for thoſe points of ſauing Religion, which we ſoundly hold, and for none other. The Martyrs dyed for the profeſsion of their faith and ſeruice to the true God, for beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt crucified (whom their perſecutors ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, the crucified God) and for their hope to bee ſaued by his merits and paſsion: for their truſt, comfort, and conſtancy in the Holy Ghoſt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the holy, bleſſed, glorious, and indiuiduall Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and for cleauing truly and conſtantly to the holy Scriptures and the doctrines grounded thereupon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7779:26"/> onely, as the true rule of their faith: and (on the other ſide) for refuſing to ſacrifice, offer incenſe, or doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Idols and Heathen gods. They ſuffered not death for ſtanding in defence of Image-worſhip, or for holding the doctrine of Purgatory ſo like to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poets, <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil:</hi> or for praying for the dead or to the dead: or for accuſing the holy Scriptures of inſufficiency and ambiguity, and forbidding Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people to reade them vnder great penalties, for feare of Hereſie. For, ſuch points would haue pleaſed their Heathen perſecutors well enough.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſuffered they for croſsing Chriſts inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in denying the Communion cup to Gods people: or for worſhipping a God made of a piece of bread; or for maintaining the Popes gainfull Indulgences, and Pardons, or for defence of their exorciſed Holy-water, or other ceremonies: which would haue been matter of ſcorne and laughter, rather then of perſecution from the Heathen.</p>
                  <p>Neither dyed they for defending the Popes now-claimed Supremacy ouer all the Clergy, people, and Princes of the Chriſtian world, direct, or indirect: which in thoſe times, and many ages after, was neuer thought of nor claimed: and vpon the firſt claime thereof, was moſt odious and hatefull to the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and threw the world on heapes by grieuous warres and diſſolutions: nor for other points which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now maintaineth different from vs, and which we refuſe. And therefore the great flouriſh which you make of the antiquity of your Church, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the points, which at this day you doe with all policy and violence maintaine) vtterly failes you, and indeed makes againſt you. For they are not the ancient doctrines of the Church, but later or newer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions and corruptions, ſo that in reſpect of them your Religion is new and not ours; you are the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uators, and not we.</p>

A myſtery worketh not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, but ſecretly: not at once, but by little and little, and then getteth greateſt aduantage, when it is leaſt obſerued and ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>It is firſt a Myſtery, and creepeth in ſecretly, before it be a Hiſtory, obſerued and deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>In Common-wealthes it is ordinary for things of obſcure and vnſenſible beginnings, to worke ſenſible and notorious changes in the end, ſo that the wiſeſt ſhall not ſo eaſily finde out the firſt entrance, as the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt may ſee and feele the groſſe and dangerous euents in the end. As <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerueth in the life of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and in the life of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> he tels how the corruption of the people by bribes and banquetting, entred into the old <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth. This Peſtilence (ſaith he) crept in by little and little, and did ſecretly win ground, ſtil continuing a long time in <hi>Rome,</hi> before it was openly diſcouered, For no man can tell who was the firſt that bought mens voyces with money, nor that corrupted the ſentence of the Iudges: but he knoweth that this tooke away all authority (and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Common-wealth.) So it is alſo with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in mans body: they come not to the height and extremity at firſt, and at once: but ill humours and matter of diſeaſes, breed ſecretly, and inſenſibly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by degrees, become more full and ſtrong, and ſeldome are well diſcerned, till they manifeſtly impaire the health and actions of the body. Now when a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is growne apparantly dangerous and deadly, ſhall neither the Phyſitian nor the grieued Patient beleeue that there is any diſeaſe at all, becauſe they know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there was once health, and they cannot ſet downe the time when the humours began firſt to corrupt, nor by what acceſſes and increaſings it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that deſperate danger?<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.</note> So <hi>Naaman,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7779:34"/> he was once cleane and could not tell the very time, meanes, and degrees of the comming of his leproſie, might be proued to be cleane ſtill, and needed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prophet nor the waſhing.</p>
                  <p>Our Sauiour ſheweth,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> that in the field where good feed was ſowen, the enemy ſecretly ſowed tares: but they were not diſcerned to be tares, till they were growne vp to ſome height; and peraduenture fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, watered, and defended by the Husbandmen, and thought to be good Corne for a time, till they ſhewed themſelues more fully. Shall we be ſo idle to ſay, they were not tares, becauſe we know good wheat was ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en there, but when any tares were ſowen we know not? The Maſter of the field acknowledgeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent view to be tares, and ſaith that the enemy had ſowen them ſecretly: but your argument would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the contrary. You Proteſtants grant (ſay your Doctors) that the ſeed firſt ſowen in this field (in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) was good, and there ſowen by the Maſter himſelfe: now, if theſe which you call tares, be no good Graine, but weedes ſprung vp from ſome other ſeed, tell vs the mans name that ſowed it, and the time when it was ſowen. If you be not able to ſhew this, ſurely your eyes deceiue you; either they are not tares (as you call them) or they are not of any enemies, but of your owne Maſters ſowing.</p>

                  <p>And this claimed power of the Pope, diſſolving the whole frame of Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and forme of gouernment ſettled by Chriſt, was thought no leſſe hurtfull then the bringing in of hereſie and falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by all that wrote againſt it: and therefore they impute vnto it, <hi>Hereſim peſtilentiſsimam,</hi> and all ſuch things as belong onely to Antichriſt and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the deſire of worldly wealth and honour drew on many corruptions of doctrine. For when the ouer-politicke Popes found but few learned i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This deſire of wealth and greatneſſe, brought in Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which the holy Scriptures ſo plainly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully condemne.

                  <p>But when the Popes ambition and couetouſneſſe grew ſo great, that they were not content with Chriſts heauenly Kingdome, but would ſuper-adde vnto it an earthly kingdome, and make of Chriſts mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, and Church triumphant vpon earth, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church Monarchy (as Doctor <hi>Sanders</hi> entitles it) ouer-topping all other Kingdomes of ciuill Princes, Kings and Emperours: and draw out of all Countries the Wealth and Treaſure of the world to maintaine it: Then the Miniſters and Preachers of Chriſts ordaining, would not ſerue their turne, but would rather oppoſe. And therefore it was the popes beſt policy to diſgrace and diſable them: and to finde out and ſet vp others fitter for their purpoſe, to preach in all places of the world, by the authority and priuiledge of the Popes onely, and wholly exempted from the Biſhops iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and from all controule of other Miniſters or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers whatſoeuer.

                     </note>During this contention at <hi>Paris,</hi> The Fryers forged a new Goſpell (fitter, it ſeemes, for their purpoſe then Chriſts Goſpell) and called it the Goſpell of the Holy Ghoſt, and the euerlaſting Goſpell, <hi>Evangelium aeternum;</hi> labouring to make men beleeue it was more perfect, better, and worthier then the Goſpell of Chriſt, as the Sunne was more perfect then the Mooue, and the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of a Nut better then the ſhell; and that Chriſts Goſpell ſhould then ceaſe, and this ſhould come in the roome of it and continue for euer. And this Goſpell continued 55 yeares without any open reprehenſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and at length was ſet forth to be openly read and expounded in the Vniuerſity of <hi>Paris, anno</hi> 1255.

After much contention, finally the matter was brought before the pope, <hi>anno</hi> 1256. who (with aduice of his Cardinals) tooke order, that this Goſpell and all the copies thereof, ſhould be ſecretly burned, and not openly reprehended for diſgracing their Orders: and alſo that the <hi>Pariſians</hi> bookes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt it, ſhould be publikely burned.

                  <p>This exceeding great <hi>Dignity and Wealth,</hi> meeting together, allured many to deſire theſe places. And the politicke popes vſed to chuſe Cardinals of two ſorts: ſome of Noble and potent families, to adde
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7779:82"/> ſtrength by the aliance of Princes and great Nobles, and to get intelligence and Oares in their gouernment: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of great wit and learning, by that meanes alſo to enlarge and vphold the Papacy againſt learned Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. For euen Princes and Nobles ſecond ſonnes, or other kinſmen wanting maintenance to ſupport their Nobility, were either of themſelues deſirous, or might eaſily be induced to accept of ſuch places: and their parents and friends were glad to be ſo eaſed of the charge to maintaine them: and the whole families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereby aſſured friends to the Papacy, and good inſtruments to vphold and defend it. On the other ſide many learned men, that wanted both Nobility and maintenance, and thirſted after both, by hauing ſuch braue places beſtowed vpon them, tooke themſelues to be bound, by all their wit, learning, and diligence to maintaine them.</p>
                  <p>But it was not altogether ſafe to haue Cardinals in whom both theſe things, (Nobility of blood, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of learning) did meet, leſt knowing a double wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in themſelues, they ſhould not be ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to their places, as their places to them: nor ſo pliable or ready to doe their beſt in their defence, when they found themſelues able to ſtand without them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Cardinals of both ſorts, by their kindred, wit, learning, policy, counſell, and diligence in managing the ſtate, are great vpholders of the Papacy: and yet beyond all this, the pope makes a further vſe of them: to wit, to ſhew a needleſneſſe of any councels, either generall or particular.

And why ſhould he call the other, which he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, generall, when the right manner of calling them, and of ordering them, and ſafe comming to them, and freedome of voyces, were all taken away: If things be thus carried, what needes any Senate of the whole Church, when a Senate of preſent Cardinals, either can doe all, or muſt doe all? Therefore this inuention, ſtate, and choyce of Cardinals, is a powerfull, politicke deuice to maintaine the Papacy, and keepe off the ſtrongeſt oppoſition.</p>

                  <p>Pardons likewiſe were extended to them that went on pilgrimage to the Shrines, Images or Reliques of Saints, and there offered vp their money and deuotions.

                  <p>Obſerue here by the way, that to maintaine the great profit that comes in by purgatory and pardons, the popes poſitions found a neceſsity to corrupt the true ancient Doctrine of Iuſtification; and to teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the Fathers had done: to wit; that a man endued with Gods grace, is able to fulfill the whole Law: and conſequently that hee may be iuſtified by his owne workes, and that his workes are truly meritorious of eternall life: yea, further, that he is able to do works of ſupererogation (that is, more then he needed to doe for his owne ſaluation) euen workes that may be imputed or aſcribed vnto other men (that want) to merit their deliuery out of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: and that theſe ſuper-abundant merits (or works of ſupererogation) may by the pope (Chriſts Vicar or Vicegerent) be applyed, giuen (or ſold) to whom he thinkes good. A quaint deuiſe! but without all this, purgatory, pardons, pilgrimages, Maſſes for the dead, &amp;c. are to no purpoſe. If Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine

For we know it is ſometimes toſſed with the waues of Errours, Schiſmes, Perſecutions; ſo that to the vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not wiſely eſteeming the reaſons of Times and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7779:98"/> Circumſtances of things, it is <hi>hard to be knowen.</hi> Which then ſpecially happened, when the perfidiouſneſſe of the <hi>Arians,</hi> domineerd well neere in all the world. For at that time wrote Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> that the ſhip of the Church was almoſt ouerwhelmed. And <hi>Hilary</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in many words, that the Church at that time was not to be ſought, <hi>Jn tectis &amp; exteriori pompa, ſed potius in carceribus &amp; ſpeluncis</hi> (not in houſes or Temples and outward pompe, but rather in priſons and caues.) Therefore we deny not, but that it is harder to diſcerne the Church one time then another. But this we affirme, that it may alwayes be knowne of them that weigh things wiſely. For in that very time when it ſeemed to be hid, compared with the times foregoing, it might be perceiued, that the Church was not with the multitude of Innovators, but rather with thoſe few who followed that which the ancient Fathers of the Church and all the faithfull held, with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and long continuance. Thus writes <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Valence.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">B.

                     <hi>Antiquus.</hi> But why haue you left off any of thoſe cuſtomes and ceremonies which were vſed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? what reaſon had you for that?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antiquiſsimus.</hi> Firſt, the ſame reaſon that <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> had to breake &amp; aboliſh the brazen Serpent, which had been of good vſe to the honour of God, and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men: but in his time was abuſed to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the ſame reaſon that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had, againſt the <hi>Agapae</hi> or Feaſts of Loue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19, 20, 21, 22. For, (as your <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> acknowledge vpon that place) at firſt the richer Chriſtians made feaſts (bringing ſtore of meat and drinke to the Churches) to ioy and cheare vp themſelues and the poore that wanted, when they came to receiue the holy Sacrament: which Feaſts were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Agapae,</hi> Feaſts of Charity. Theſe Feaſts afterwards through abuſe, became occaſions of pride in them that had to bring, of contempt to them that had not, of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7779:130"/> and drunkenneſſe, yea, of rejecting the poore, and of the formoſt, deuouring all without expecting one another. This occaſioned Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reproofe of them then: and the whole abrogation of them afterward.</p>

It cannot be otherwiſe, for the Proteſtants differ among themſelues, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>German,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> one Nation from
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7779:143"/> another, and in euery Nation one company from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is poſsible the Fathers may diſagree from them all; but to agree with them all, that agree not among themſelues, it is impoſsible. Beſides, the Proteſtants diſagreements are ſo great, with ſuch bitter contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and virulent writing one againſt another, that they ſhew themſelues not to be of the Church of God, which is a City at vnity in it ſelfe; and conſiſts of men more mortifyed in their affections. I tell you truely, theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements and contentions do mightily alienate mens affections from your Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antiquiſsimus.</hi> Your obiection hath three parts, 1 Differences of the Fathers from vs; 2 Differences among our ſelues; 3 The hot contentions of Proteſtants for theſe differences. Let me anſwer them in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I doe ingenuouſly confeſſe that the Fathers do in many things differ from vs: and no whit leſſe from you. Though they were very Reuerend learned &amp; holy men, yet ſtill they were men, and had their errours and imperfections. Your owne men firſt diſcouered them (as <hi>Cham</hi> did his Fathers nakedneſſe and told his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.) and we cannot hide them (though wee gladly would, and with <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> turne our backs on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) neither is it now expedient, when you ſo much vilifie the Scriptures, and magnifie the Fathers beyond their right: and ſeeke to draw the tryall of the truth of Religion, rather then the Riuelets of Fathers and Hiſtories, then from the Fountaine of the Scriptures. We muſt therfore tell you more neceſſarily the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what your own men haue ſaid, of the Fathers ſlips and errours, wherein not onely we, but themſelues are conſtrained for the truthes ſake to forſake them. And yet both wee and they account the ſame Fathers our predeceſſors for the other neceſſary points of ſauing faith, which they ſoundly held, neither doe we any way doubt but that they are bleſſed Saints in Heauen.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, both parties agree in the neceſsity of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers due preparing themſelues, with knowledge of their ſinnes, repentance of them, faith in Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them, and reſolution to liue according to Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, both ſides agree in the acknowledgement of the excellent vſe of the Sacrament for a perpetuall memoriall of the death and paſsion of Chriſt for our ſaluation, and that with him we ſhould dye to ſinne and be raiſed againe to newneſſe of life; be made one with him; and nouriſhed by him in a ſpirituall life here, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, both ſides agree, that the very body and blood of Chriſt are to be receiued in that Sacrament, that thereby we may be partakers of the life of Grace, and alſo be ſtrengthened, confirmed, and continued therein.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, both ſides agree, that the elements of bread and wine, preſenting to our conſideration and faith, the ſpirituall nouriſhing force that is in the body and blood of Chriſt, are not aboliſhed in their ſubſtance: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed in their vſe; which is, not onely to ſignifie, but alſo to exhibit and communicate vnto vs, the very

                  <p>Sixtly, both parties agree, and profeſſe they firmely beleeue, that the very Body and Blood of Chriſt (which the Sacraments doe not onely ſignifie, but exhib t, and whereof the faithfull are partakers) are truely preſent in the Sacrament, and by the faithfull truely and really receiued.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre all parties agree, that is, in the whole ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſufficient ſubſtance of the doctrine of this Sacrament: for the other matter wherein they differ, <hi>De modo,</hi> of the manner how Chriſt is preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſeeing it is not expreſſed in the Scriptures, In the iudgement of <hi>Zanchius,</hi> it might be well omitted: themſelues confeſſe, when they haue gone as farre as they can to determine it, ſtill it is ineffable, and not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be fully vnderſtood.

                  <p>But I pray you, what other differences of moment do ye finde among the Proteſtants:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antiquus.</hi> When the Diuines of the Reformed in <hi>France</hi> were called to the <hi>Mompelgart colloquy</hi> in the yeare 1586: they looked for no more differences then of our Lords Supper, which you ſpake of; but they found more, of the Perſon of Chriſt, of Predeſtination, of Baptiſme, of Images in Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antiquiſsmus.</hi> They found thoſe fiue indeed. And it was a wonderfull prouidence of God, that ſo many ſeuerall Countries, Kingdomes, and States, abandoning the abuſes of the Church or rather Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and making particular Reformations in their own domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without generall meetings and conſents, ſhould haue no more, nor greater differences then theſe.</p>
                  <p>And of theſe, the firſt two (of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament, and of the communication of properties of the diuinity and humanity in the perſon of Chriſt) are in a maner all one, and reconciled both alike: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two next, the differences among the Fathers, (who notwithſtanding ſtill continued mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame true Catholik Church) may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the differences among the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>And for the fifth difference, concerning Images; it proued no difference at all. Both ſides therin fully agreed.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are not the Tithe of the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your men: and in theſe fiue which you reckon, many of your owne men differ one from another, and yet with you are good Catholiks.</p>

                     <hi>Antiquiſsimus.</hi> Thoſe that do ſo are much to blame. It is farre from mee to defend them. Yet you know ſometimes very holy and well mortified men, may happen into ſtrange contentions euen for ſmal matters. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> appointed by the Holy Ghoſt to ioyne for the worke of the miniſtry in planting Churches among the <hi>Gentiles (Acts</hi> 13.2) which they did very laboriouſly, cheerefully, &amp; with good ſucceſſe, and though they ſuffered perſecution in doing it, yet were comfortably deliuered, and allwayes found God (who had ſent them) preſent to protect and bleſſe them: and afterwards they were ſent by the Church to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to the Apoſtles and elders,<note place="margin">Acts 15.1, 2.</note> about queſtions that troubled the Church: and by the whole Councell of Apoſtles, they were ſent againe Iointly to the Churches of <hi>Antioch, Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> and other Nations, to giue them notice of the decrees of the Councell, to direct and confirme the brethren: now hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered their meſſage and done their buſineſſe impoſed, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and were ſo to go forward to <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia;</hi> They fell to contention: and for a matter of no great moment, to wit, <hi>Barnabas</hi> would haue <hi>Iohn</hi> to goe with them, and <hi>Paul</hi> refuſed him: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention grew ſo ſharp, that they parted company, and went ſeuerall wayes.</p>
                  <p>See how fleſh and blood boyled in theſe good mens hearts! Euen in thoſe mens hearts, whom God had made ſpeciall choyce of, and Ioyned them together for his moſt eſpeciall and extraordinary workes: vpon whom the Church of God after faſting and prayer had laid their hands, and ſeparated them to goe Ioyntly together about that holy buſines; who had power to doe many miracles and extraordinary workes:<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> who made report of the wonderfull ſucceſſe which God gaue them in conuerting the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the great admiration and conſolation of the Apoſtles: whom the Apoſtles ſent againe with their decrees to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7779:153"/> Churches: euen theſe holy men, fell out for a light cauſe and parted company.</p>
                  <p>Haply ſome man might ſay, Are theſe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted truely mortified and holy men, who were carried away with ſuch a humor of pride and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus would ſome men gather out of this action: But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (a choſen veſſell, yet ſtill an earthen veſſel, who knew well he had his cracks and his flawes, himſelfe gathereth another thing: (2 <hi>cor.</hi> 4.6.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note>) God, who hath commanded the light to ſhine out of darknes, hath ſhined in our hearts, to giue the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God in the face of Ieſus Chirſt: But we haue this treaſure in earthen veſſels that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of vs.</p>

                     <p>The Seuenth article ſetteth out the laſt Iudgement day, when Chriſt in his humane Fleſh ſhall deſcend againe from the higheſt heauen, and performing the office of the terrible Iudge of the whole earth, ſhall openly render vnto euery one according as he hath done in his body, whether it be good or euill: before whoſe tribunall all men both good and euill ſhall ſtand, whether that day of Iudgement finde them yet aliue in the fleſh, or dead before.</p>

                     <p>He reduceth them to ſixe principall heades: Firſt, concerning God, whom to know is eternall life: we muſt beleeue and acknowledge the vnity of an infinite, incomprehenſible, and eternall eſſence, full of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, goodneſſe, mercy, and trueth; The Trinity of perſons ſubſiſting in the ſame eſſence; the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, coeſſentiall, coeternall, and coequall: the Father not created, nor begotten, the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7779:163"/> Sonne not created but begotten, the holy Ghoſt not created nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt know and beleeue, that God made all things of nothing, that in them he might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his wiſdome, power, and goodneſſe, that he made men and Angels capable of ſupernaturall bleſſedneſſe, conſiſting in the viſion and enioying of himſelfe; that he gaue them abilities to attaine thereunto, and lawes to guide them in the wayes that lead vnto it; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was made euill in the beginning; that all euill entred into the world by the voluntary averſion of men and Angels from God their Creator; that the ſinne of Angels was not generall, but that ſome fell, and other continued in their firſt eſtate; that the ſinne of thoſe Angels that fell is irremiſsible, and their fall irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable; that theſe are become deuils and ſpirits of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſeeking the deſtruction of the ſonnes of men; that by the miſperſwaſion of theſe lying ſpirits, the firſt man that euer was in the world, fell from God by ſinnefull diſobedience and apoſtacy; that the ſinne of the firſt man is deriued to all his poſterity, not by imitation onely, but by propagation and deſcent, ſubiecting all to curſe and malediction; yet not without poſsibility and hope of mercifull deliuerance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we muſt beleeue, that for the working of this deliuerance, the Sonne of God aſſumed the nature of man, into the vnity of his Diuine perſon; ſo that he ſubſiſteth in the nature of God, and Man, without all corruption, confuſion, or conuerſion of one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: that in the nature of man thus aſſumed, he ſuffered death but being God could not be holden of it, but roſe againe, and triumphantly aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: that he ſatisfied the wrath of his Father, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for vs remiſsion of ſinnes paſt, the grace of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conuerſion, and a new conuerſation, ioyned with aſſured hope, deſire, and expectation of eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:7779:164"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, we muſt conſtantly beleeue, that God doth call and gather to himſelfe out of the manifold confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of erring, ignorant, and wretched men, whom hee pleaſeth, to be partakers of theſe precious benefits of eternall ſaluation: the happy number and ioyfull ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of whom, we name the Church of God; whether they were before or ſince the manifeſtation of Chriſt the Sonne of God in our fleſh.

                     <p>Fiftly, we muſt know and beleeue, that for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of this ioyfull deliuerance, and the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the benefits of the ſame, the Sonne of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thoſe his followers, whom he choſe to bee witneſſes of all things he did or ſuffered, not onely the word of Reconciliation, but alſo the diſpenſation of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſacramentall aſſurances of his loue, ſet meanes of his gracious working: that thoſe firſt meſſenge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Laſtly, we muſt know, and be aſſuredly perſwaded, that ſeeing the renouation of our ſpirits and mindes is not perfect; and the redemption, of our bodies ſtill remaining corruptible, is not yet; therefore God hath appointed a time, when Chriſt ſhall returne againe, raiſe vp the dead, and giue eternall life to all, that with repentant ſorrow, turne from their euill and wicked wayes, while it is yet the accepted time, and day of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7779:164"/> ſaluation; and contrary wayes, caſt out into vtter darkeneſſe, and into the fire that neuer ſhall be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, all thoſe that neglect, &amp; deſpiſe ſo great ſaluation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Antiquiſsimus.</hi> This is a ſhameles vntruth. For when the Deane and Chapter had elected <hi>D.

                     <hi>Bell.</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth) I will (to auoyd offence to both) vſe the word Presbyter: (which the Apoſtles vſed, and which I ſee our late learned writers do more willingly frequent) to ſignifie ſuch as haue taken full orders in the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7779:182"/> Church of God.

Apoſtles, and preferring the words of ſome Fathers, and vſing them contrary to their meaning. But, Then I doubt not to affirme that Orders giuen to Presbyters by Presbyters onely, in times of neceſsity, when Biſhops cannot be procured to giue them, are of full validity, and ſufficiency. For, the giuing of orders was appointed to Biſhops, not of abſolute neceſsity, but for their greater honour, and for the better gouernment and preſeruation of peace and vnity in the Church, and for thoſe and the like reaſons, it is fit, that courſe be obſerued, when poſsibly it may.

Neither doe I thinke that euer any controuerſie would haue beene amongſt vs of this point, if the Popes had not abuſed this authority to a certaine ſhew of Domination, and ſtretched it beyond the bounds preſcribed by Chriſt &amp; the Church, through their ambition and couetouſneſſe. But this abuſe of that Biſhops power, which firſt his flatterers ſtretched out beyond meaſure, gaue occaſion to men to thinke ill of the power it ſelfe, which that Biſhop had obtained by the vniuerſall conſent of the whole Church: yea, it gaue occaſion to men wholly to forſake it, which yet I thinke hee might recouer (ſaith <hi>Caſſander</hi>) if hee would reduce it within the limits preſcribed by Chriſt and the ancient Church; and vſe it according to Chriſts Goſpell, and the tradition of his anceſtors, onely to the edification of the Church. Therefore at the firſt, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> thought, and wrote modeſtly enough of the power of the Pope, though afterwards being offended and enraged at the moſt abſurd writing of ſome of his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, he inueighed more bitterly againſt it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And in the next page before this, <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non negarim,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot deny, but many men were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled at firſt by a godly care ſharpely to reproue ſome manifeſt abuſes: and the principall cauſe of this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and diſtraction of the Church is to be imputed to them that being puffed vp with a vaine pride of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall power, did proudly and diſdainfully contemne and reiect thoſe that iuſtly and modeſtly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them. Wherefore I thinke there is no firme peace of the Church to be hoped for, except it take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from them who gaue the firſt cauſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; that is, that thoſe that ſit at the ſterne of Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, remit ſomething of their too much rigor, and yeeld ſomething to the peace of the Church, and harkening to the earneſt enertaties and admonitions of many godly men, correct manifeſt

                  <p n="1">1 The authority mentioned by Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> is onely Credit and Eſtimation; for ſo <hi>Ierom</hi> expreſſeth his owne meaning. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> went vp to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to conferre of the Goſpel with them that were eſteemed, that is, with <hi>Peter</hi> and other Apoſtles, <hi>to wit,</hi> with <hi>Iames, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who were eſteemed to be Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2.9. for his conference with Apoſtles of ſuch authority or eſtimation might adde ſome credit, authority and eſtimation to his preaching in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds. If by authority Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> did meane ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power ouer the other Apoſtles, then <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould haue had it as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> which is not your Catholike doctrine. Alſo an inferiour (or equall) in power, may be ſuperiour in authority or eſtimation: as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith of <hi>Metellus</hi> a priuate man (though choſen Conſull for the yeere following) That hee forbade cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine playes (when an officer had allowed them) and that which he could not obtaine by power,<note place="margin">Cicero oratione in Piſonem.</note> he did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by authority: that is, with the credit which hee had with the people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Primacy which the Fathers ſpeake of, was the Primacy of Order, not of Power, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt called to be an Apoſtle, and firſt reckoned; this argues no more power then the Fore-man of the Iury hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The prerogatiue of Principality, was in the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of grace, and not of power, (as we ſay, the Prince of Philoſophers, <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the Prince of Poets, <hi>Homer;</hi> that is, the wittieſt, or moſt excellent, not Lord and maſter ouer the reſt.)

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7779:219"/> by the Pope from his curſe. Whereupon hee was compelled ſore againſt his will to goe and ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Pope, and finding the Pope at <hi>Canuſium,</hi> put off his kingly robes, and waited three daies barefoot in very cold weather at the Popes gate, crauing pardon for his deeds: a ſpectacle to men and Angels, and a mocking ſtock to his proud enemies. At laſt, by mediation of the Empreſſe his mother, &amp; <hi>Matildis</hi> his kinſwoman, and at the earneſt intreaty of all his people crying for pitty, with much difficulty hee obtained abſolution from his Anathema.</p>
                  <p>This ſtorme thus blowne ouer, rayſed another; for many condemned <hi>Henry</hi> for baſeneſſe in himſelfe, and wrong to them, whom he had brought into trouble, and now made his peace with their enemy ſo bad a man, an enemy to all religion and goodneſſe, when hee ſhould haue beene a protector of his friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and a reuenger of Eccleſiaſticall lawes viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thus the Princes and Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> raiſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Emperour, with purpoſe to chuſe <hi>Henries</hi> ſonne, though young, and to goe with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to ſet vp another Pope who ſhould preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Emperour, and nullifie all the acts of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Pope. This, <hi>Caeſar</hi> hearing of, ſent to appeaſe their minds, excuſing all by neceſſity, and promiſing henceforward to right all things amiſſe.

                  <p>The Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond, was valiant, learned, liberall, magnificall, and gaue great gifts and lands to the Church to procure the Popes fauour; yet he found that the Pope receiued his enemies, publike rebels, and foſtered them flying vnto him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was much offended, yea the Pope (<hi>to wit, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ninth) excommunicated and anathematized him.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7779:221"/> for no other cauſe, but that he went not yet to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to fight againſt Gods enemies, as he had promiſed, and for which he had taken the Croſſe vpon him. Which iourney, the Emperour anſwered, was onely deferred, till he had ſetled the Imperiall buſineſſe, and ſhould find a fit time, and that he was prouiding all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for that iourney. Meane ſeaſon, the Pope mightily vexed him, and wrought much euill to the Empire: and when the Emperour called an aſſembly of Princes at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> they of <hi>Verena</hi> and <hi>Millan</hi> intercepted the Princes way, and preyed vpon them that had taken the Croiſado for the holy Land, robbing them of their prouiſion, and that by the Popes commandement (who had procured the voyage, and written to all Chriſtian Princes to make it, and thruſt the Emperour and all men into it.) Yet the Emperour went forwards, and while he was abſent from his Countrey, in this holy voyage, labouring to defend by his ſword Chriſts ſheepe from the Wolfe, the Pope himſelfe did ſheare, ſlay, and deuoure them. While <hi>Fredericke</hi> tooke <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Nazareth, Ioppe,</hi> and other Townes from the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian Sultan,</hi> and made ten yeeres peace with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified the holy City and diuerſe others and was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King there with great ioy vpon Eaſter day, and wrote to the Pope of his happy ſucceſſe, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome might reioyce: That proud vicar of Chriſt, in his abſence had, with a great army, entred <hi>Apulia,</hi> taken it, and made it ſubiect to himſelfe, forbidden them that had taken the Croſſe to paſſe the ſeas, and draue them out of <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and did many monſtrous things vnworthy a Pope or Biſhop. And now receiuing the Emperors letters, contemned them, caſt them away, and ſpread a rumor that the Emperor was dead, that he might the better thereby draw ſome Cities of <hi>Apulia</hi> to yeeld to him, which hitherto kept their faith to the Emperour.

The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſeeing Chriſtians come croſſed againſt him (who had vſed to fight for the Croſſe of Chriſt againſt Infidels) moued with indignation, commanded the heads of them that were ſo croſſed (whom hee tooke with great ſlaughter) to bee cut into foure parts. And at laſt leauing the City, he tooke <hi>Beneuentum,</hi> and thence leading his army to the <hi>Picentes,</hi> waſted the <hi>Aeſculans</hi> fields: then he euery where ſeized on the Templars goods, and did other much hurt.

Then <hi>Fredericke</hi> ſpoyled <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentia,</hi> oppreſſed firſt with famine: depriued <hi>Bononia</hi> of the Vniuerſity, and tranſlated it to <hi>Padua,</hi> and beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Parma.</hi> Meane ſeaſon <hi>Innocent</hi> III. was made Pope who formerly had beene a friend to <hi>Fredericke,</hi> but now placed in the Papall dignity, became his deadly enemy, as <hi>Gregory</hi> had beene before.

Alas, all was contrary to your fancy. There could not be a greater meanes deuiſed by Sathan to ſcourge the Empire, to weaken Chriſtendome to make way for the Turke, to plague <hi>Italy,</hi> and to vndoe the Pope himſelfe, than the Pope himſelfe deuiſed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. The woefull concluſion was; When the Pope had thus farre prouoked the Emperor, procured much euill to many Cities and Countries, and ſo fired the world, that by the light and waſte thereof, the Turke might ſee an eaſie entrance into Chriſtendome: then hee ſtudied night and day how to deſtroy the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: ſome conſpiracies were diſcouered: but finally, poyſoned he was effectually, wherein his baſtard ſonne <hi>Manfredus</hi> was thought to be an Agent, by the Popes procuring.

                     <hi>Anſelme</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did ſomewhat trouble King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, for whereas in former times, the Biſhops and Abbots of England vſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their Inueſtitures from the King, by receiuing a Paſtorall Staffe and Ring at his hand (as Saint <hi>Wulſtan</hi> had done from St. <hi>Edward</hi> the King, profeſſing thereby he would reſigne it onely to him) now <hi>Anſelme</hi> refuſed to conſecrate certaine Biſhops whom the King aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and gaue them their Inueſtitures, ſo that the King was compelled to ſend an Embaſſage to the Pope <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalis,</hi> and before him to pleade his cauſe, as <hi>Anſelme</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did his in like manner.

                     </note> But <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> being made firſt Lord Chancelor, and afterwards Archbiſhop by the fauour of King <hi>Henry</hi> 2. troubled the King much more; for the King being informed of much miſdemeanour of Clergy men (who beſides other offences, had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an hundred murders in his raigne) and that they were not puniſhed nor degraded by the Biſhops, but ſhifted away into Abbeyes or otherwayes defended; ſo that the wronged had no remedy, the wrong-doers no puniſhment, true innocent men no ſafety, and none of them were in condition of ſubiects: the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch to be puniſhed by his Lawes, and to haue the cuſtomes of his Anceſtors obſerued: whereunto all the Biſhops aſſented, but onely <hi>Becket;</hi> who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſted, but complained of the King to Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> at firſt, deſiring to hold the Kings loue, willed <hi>Becket</hi> to yeeld, and <hi>Becket</hi> ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the King abſolutely. But when the King aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his States at <hi>Clarendon</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire, Becket</hi> relapſed, and ſaid hee had grieuouſly ſinned in promiſing, but would not ſinne in performing, yet at the inſtance and teares of many Noble perſons and others priuately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him for the good of the whole land, he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe and promiſed <hi>in verbo ſacerdotali</hi> to obſerue all; and all the Earles, Biſhops, Abbots, and Clergy did ſweare and promiſe the like: but when hee ſhould ſet his hand and ſeale to a writing thereof, hee refuſed againe. Of all this the King by Embaſſage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Pope, deſiring a legantiue power to be ſent to the B. of <hi>Yorke:</hi> which the Pope vnwillingly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and withall made it ſo ſlight, that the King in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſent the Bull backe againe to the Pope.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7779:227"/> which he refuſed to doe, and to come vnto the King: and being told, he would be condemned of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury and treaſon for not yeelding temporall alleagiance to his temporall Soueraigne (as hee had ſworne) and that the Prelates would diſclayme all obedience vnto him as their Archbiſhop: hee cauſed to bee ſung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at the Altar, The Princes ſit and ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee, and the vngodly perſecute me: And forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with taking his ſiluer Croſier in his hands, went armed into the Kings preſence. Whereat, the King inraged, cauſed his Peeres to proceed in iudgement againſt him; they condemne him to priſon for treaſon and periury; he appeales to <hi>Rome,</hi> and away gets him into <hi>France,</hi> procures the French Kings fauour, and by him, the Popes. To the Pope the King ſends a Noble Embaſſage deſiring to haue two Cardinalls ſent into England to end the matter. The Pope denies it, reſeruing the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelfe. The King by his Sherifs, Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters all <hi>Beckets</hi> profits in England; <hi>Becket</hi> in <hi>France</hi> excommunicates all in England that maintained the Auitall (or ancient) cuſtomes, naming ſome great men. The King fearing his owne excommunication, gathers a great Army, pretending to ſubdue Wales. Meane ſeaſon the Pope is perſwaded to ſend two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls; but they cannot perſwade <hi>Becket</hi> to yeeld any thing, and ſo that deſigne for peace was fruſtrate. At length the two Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, met in <hi>France:</hi> before whom, <hi>Becket</hi> being called, and earneſtly dealt withall, would not yeeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, ſo that all men blamed him. The Pope willed <hi>Gilbert</hi> B. of <hi>London</hi> to admoniſh the King to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: hee did ſo, but excuſed the King to the Pope. The Pope excommunicates <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and went ſo farre, that the King had ſcarce one left to reade diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in his Chappell. The King prayes the Pope to ſend two Cardinals to abſolue his ſubiects, and to make peace: Two come into <hi>Normandy,</hi> but returne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7779:227"/> poſſibility of doing any good, becauſe <hi>Becket</hi> would not yeeld a iot. At laſt, by the Popes mediation the two Kings met at <hi>Paris,</hi> where King <hi>Henry</hi> offered to ſtand to the iudgement of the Diuines of <hi>Paris,</hi> but no peace would be had. After all this the King crowned his ſonne, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> ſupplying <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> abſence. And in the beginning of the ſeuenth yeere of the baniſhment of <hi>Becket,</hi> the two Kings met againe in <hi>France,</hi> and the King (fearing the whole Realmes interdiction by the Pope,) receiued <hi>Becket</hi> into fauour, yeelding him his Biſhopricke with all the profits and arrearages, and ſignified it to his ſonne in England. Now <hi>Becket</hi> Archbiſhop in England, ſhortly after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Popes letters ſuſpending the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> (for crowning the young King, which was <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburies</hi> office) with all his adiuuants, and would not abſolue them but vpon conditions at the earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the young King: which the Father King hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in <hi>Normandy,</hi> was ſore diſpleaſed; and ſhewed it by ſome words: which, foure Knights Courtiers, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and thinking to doe a great pleaſure to the King, and to eaſe the Kingdome of much trouble, poſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England; and at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the next day after <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents</hi> day killed the Archbiſhop at the high Altar, and fled into the North.

            <p>Secondly of himſelfe, his owne times, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, he writeth thus:</p>
            <p>One thing is neceſſary,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> in his anſwer to the Oration of Cardinall <hi>Perene. pag.</hi> 243.</note> namely the feare and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my God: vnto whoſe Majeſty alone I haue deuoted my ſcepter, my ſword, my penne, my whole induſtry, my whole ſelfe, with all that is mine, in whole and in part. I do it, I do it in all humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his vnſpeakable mercy and ſauour, who hath vouchſafed to deliuer mee from the erroneous way of this age, to deliuer my Kingdome from the Popes tirannicall yoke, vnder which it hath Fen in times paſt moſt greeuouſly oppreſſed. My Kingdome, where God is now purely ſerued, and called vpon in a tongue which all the vulgar vnderſtand. My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where the People may now read the Scriptures, without any ſpeciall priuiledge from the Apoſtolike ſea, and with no leſſe liberty then the people of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Corinth</hi> did read the holy Epiſtles written to their Churches by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where the people now pay no longer any tribute by the poll for Papall indulgences, as they did about an hundred yeares paſt; and are no longer compelled to the Mart, for pardons beyond the Seas and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: but haue them now freely offred from God by the Doctrine of the Goſpell preached at home, within their owne ſeuerall pariſhes and Iuriſdictions.</p>
            <p>And in another place he ſaith thus:<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. <hi>274.</hi>
               </note> Greater bleſſings of God, greater outward peace and plenty, greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, with ſpiritual and celeſtiall pleaſures were neuer heaped vpon my Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> then haue beene ſince my Great <hi>Britaine</hi> became great in the greateſt &amp; chiefeſt reſpect of all; to wit, ſince my Great <hi>Britaine</hi> hath ſhaken of the Popes yoake; ſince ſhe hath refuſed to receiue and to entertaine the Popes Legates, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to collect Saint <hi>Peters</hi> tribute, or <hi>Peter</hi> pence; ſince the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> my Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> haue not beene the Popes Vaſſals, to doe him Homage for

            <p>Of <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> &amp; <hi>Frieſland,</hi> what need I ſpeake? Yet a word and no more. Were they not a kinde of naked and bare people, of ſmall valew, before God lighted the torch of the Goſpell, and aduanced it in thoſe Nations? were they not an ill-fed and ſcragged people, in compariſon of the ineſtimable wealth and proſperity (both in all military actions, and mechanicall trades, in traffick as Marchants, in marting as men of warre, in long nauigation for diſcouery) to which they are now raiſed and mounted by the mercifull ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Vpon theſe conſiderations, I. Of the excellency of the firſt primitiue Chriſtian Religion: II. Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable euils which the corruptions of <hi>Rome</hi> brought into the world, with the grones and cries of men for Reformation: and III. of the great bleſsings which the Reformation hath brought vpon the countries which receiued it; Mee thinkes there ſhould need no further perſwaſion to men of any reaſonable vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Iudgement, to forſake the vncatholike corruptions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and imbrace this ſo bleſſed a Reformation, with all due thankfulneſſe to God, for the true doctrine of Saluation, and peace of Conſcience, with the deſired peace of their eſtates, loue of Prince and Country, wealth, ioy, and happineſſe, and all both earthly and heauenly bleſsings, that mans heart in this world can deſire.</p>
